This is a Desktop Virtual Assistant, however it can work in other environments too with minor changes.<br>
You can talk to it to perform actions like opening notepad, calculator, word, excel, powerpoint, browser or taking screenshot or screen recording.<br>
You can have a normal generic conversation with it too. <br>
It comes with a GUI, that transcribes the conversation you are having with the bot.<br>
Please see the linked video to see a demo, understand it's design and how it is built (code)<br>

Before you run the code, update the .env config file with your GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY.<br>
You can get the key from Google AI Studio: https://ai.google.dev/aistudio<br>

ALthough we are using Google Gemini model here, you can use any other model of your choice - including one running locally.
